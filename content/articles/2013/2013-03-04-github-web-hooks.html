While GitHub is a nice for small projects,
it fails to manage medium to large projects. 
Email notification system is just spam and while pull request system is
implemented on top of "issues management" you can not attach tags / fields
or other state related markers.

With more than I few pull request, I found it hard to track who is assigned
for a pull request, who should review a pull request and what is the current
progress of a pull request.

All is not lost, since GitHub comes with a nice API.

Scratching my own itch I ended up writing a `server to receive GitHub
notification and implement my own notification and action rules
<https://github.com/chevah/txghserf>`_.

It comes with a simple webserver to receive GitHub Web Hooks and a simple
JS GUI to manage web hooks. Webserver is Python Twisted Klein, and GUI is
AngularJS.

Here is a quick preview:

Chech the code on `GitHub txghserf project page
<https://github.com/chevah/txghserf>`_. Any comment or suggestion is much
appreciated.
