Last 2 months I have been working on porting various free software
application from GNU/Linux to all kind of Unix and Unix-Like operating system.
The work went very well, the project evolved and now there is a need for
another person to work at this project.

If you are looking for a job related to free software please contact me.
This is a junior software developer title, no previous knowledge of other
Unix operating system is required, just a passion for free software.

You will learn and work with various operating system. Among them you can
find IBM’s midrange OS400 or mainframe OS390 or HP’s OpenVMS and HPUX.
