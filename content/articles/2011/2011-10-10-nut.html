I just found this great project called
`Network UPS Tools or nut <http://www.networkupstools.org>`_ .
It comes with fully loaded with tools for monitoring local UPS, remote
UPS and displaying the status via a weg page.


My installation is using an Must PowerAgent 1060, connected via USB.


Installing the software is easy, just use the magic words::

    sudo apt-get install nut nut-cgi

To configure nut on Ubuntu I start by reading
`this guide by a mysterious person named Shady Pixel <http://blog.shadypixel.com/monitoring-a-ups-with-nut-on-debian-or-ubuntu-linux>`_.

First I checked my driver suitable for my model in the
`Hardware Compatibility List <http://www.networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html>`_.
The model I use is not in the list, but Must is related to Mustek and all
Mustek models were using ``blazer_usb`` driver.
So I went for blazer_usb.


I added the following section in /etc/nut/ups.conf
(you can replace must-pa-1060 with your preferred name for the UPS)::

    # /etc/nut/ups.conf
    [must-pa-1060]
        driver = blazer_usb
        port = auto

I looked for the Bus and Device number together
with Vendor and Product in `lsusb`.

I changed the permission to ``666`` for /dev/bus/usb/BID/DID
(replace BID with your USB bus ID, and DID with device ID).
To automatically set the permission for future connections I
added the following udev rule::

    #/etc/udev/rules.d/10-must-pa-1060.rules
    SYSFS{idVendor}=='0665', SYSFS{idProduct}=='5161', MODE='0666'

Then I started the UPS driver via::

    $ sudo upsdrvctl start

If you get some errors like the one below, check the USB device permissions::

    Can't claim USB device [0665:5161]: could not detach kernel driver from
    interface 0: Operation not permitted
    Driver failed to start (exit status=1)


Now that the UPS driver is started, lets monitor it and export the status via
the CGI script.

You will have to configure the mode in which nut will run.
Edit ``/etc/nut/nut.conf`` and add your preferred mode::

    # /etc/nut/nut.conf
    MODE=standalone


Add an UPS daemon user via /etc/nut/upsd.users::

    # /etc/nut/upsd.users
    [ups_admin]
    password = a password here
    upsmon master

Configure the monitor to connect to this daemon via ``/etc/nut/upsmon.conf``::

    # /etc/nut/upsmon.conf
    MONITOR must-pa-1060@localhost 1 ups_admin the_password_here master


Now you can start the nut daemon and ups monitor via ``nut`` service::

    sudo service nut start


To monitor the UPS via the web CGI script I added the following line to
``/etc/nut/hosts.conf``::

    # /etc/nut/hosts.conf
    MONITOR must-pa-1060@localhost 'Must PowerAgent 1060'

Now you can access the CGI script via::

    http://HOSTNAME/cgi-bin/nut/upsstats.cgi

Enjoy!


This should be a good start, and from here you can take it to the next level.
For example, if you have 2 computers connected to the same UPS, the second
one will have to monitor the UPS daemon from the one connected via the usb to
the UPS make sure that the switch is allow connected to the UPS :)
