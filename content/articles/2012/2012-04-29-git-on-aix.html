For running Git on AIX my first stop was the RPM provided by
`Perlz AIX Archive`_. Those RPM are up to date, but they have a big dependency
list.

Perlz is great for a stable system, but I just wanted to do some quick test
on a default `IBM VLP`_ AIX system. I was looking for ``ssh`` transport as
AIX already comes with an old version of OpenSSL.

So I sat down and start compiling Git from source code.

Beside installing the `GNU Make`_ and hacking a script for GNU Install,
everything went fine.

For your convenience you can get the binary archive from
`git-1.7.10-aix.tar.gz </downloads/git-1.7.10-aix.tar.gz>`_.
It is intended to be installed in ``~/.local`` folder. It only supports
``ssh transport``, no `http or https`.

The recipe for `building git is here`_, and a `dummy GNU Install is here`_.
