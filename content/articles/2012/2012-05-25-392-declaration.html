For the last years I had to make a declaration regarding my income. This is
only required for companies.

The declaration is creating using a computer program.

This program only works on Windows. It is just a simple application which
will generate a codebar based on your company information.

When it starts, it looks like this:

It has a nice "Law" button, which can be used for checking the law's text.
When pressed it will open a Notepad, like this:

All fun and craziness begins when you want to start entering data.
It looks like this:

The size of the new windows is huge and you will have a hard time positioning
the new windows in a standard 1024/768 screen.

Event after you managed to resize the window, you will find out that the
actual view is larger that the window and will search for scrollbars along
window's margins.

The scrollbars are place in a new genius and innovative way in the top right
side of the windows, together with all other advance buttons.

After your are done entering your data, you will try to look for a Save or 
Print button... well look no further are there are no such buttons.

You will have to press the 'Exit' button, which contrary to your belief, it
will not exit the application, but rather close the current window and will
allow you to see the 'Start' window.

From the 'Start' window, the eagle eyed users will notice a button labeled
'Listare declaratie 392' (translated 'List declaration 392'). By pressing
this button you will get no feedback, but behind the scene the application
has just sent a print request to your default printer.

You don't want to print to your default printer ... bad luck! Just go and
change your default printer.

This is by far the works UI I have ever used for such a simple task!
There is no doubt that the designer, developer and the person who
approved this application are special people!
