While I am big fan of OpenWRT, somehow I got fooled by DD-WRT nice Web
GUI and ease of use.

Being stuck with DD-WRT I am trying to bring the good stuff from OpenWRT...
I want `netstat` and `nmap` and they are not easily available for DD-WRT.

While looking after an ADSL WIFI Router with support for OpenWRT, I ended
buying an Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H.
After using DD-WRT for a while, the Web UI start crashing and the SSH server
is recreating the RSA SSH keys at each boot.
I am using DD-WRT on an Linksys WRT54GS and on Asus WL-500G without any
problems, so this should be related to the build for this Bufallo device. 

This page is based on `How To Install Additional Software On Your Home Router
(DD-WRT) from How-To Geek
<http://www.howtogeek.com/98408/how-to-install-additional-software-on-your-router-dd-wrt/>`_

On the DD-WRT wiki, there is a page called `Optware, the right way` ... but
it should read "the wrong way".

First think you need to know is the CPU architecture or your router.
I am using a Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H so my arch is **ar71xx**. Check the nice
OpenWRT wiki to find out our CPU arch.

The list of supported architectures for OpenWRT trunk is here:
http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/

You will need to enable JFFS on your router. I am using ``/opt`` folder as
the root of the new OpenWRT filesystem and OpenWRT tools as an USB stick is
mounted there. Feel free to replace it with any other folder.

Get the OpenWRT base filesystem and copy the libraries in /opt::

    cd /jffs/tmp
    wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-rootfs.tar.gz
    tar -xzr openwrt-*-generic-rootfs.tar.gz
    mv lib /opt

We would need writable /etc and /var folders. As a start, copy the DD-WRT
``/etc`` folder into /opt/etc and ``/var`` into /opt/var . ``/etc`` contains 
a few symlinks to tmp files and we need to remove them and replace them
with proper files. DD-WRT's var is in /tmp/var ::

    cp -r /etc /opt
    cp -r /tmp/var /opt
    rm /opt/etc/group
    rm /opt/etc/passwd
    rm /opt/etc/resolv.conf
    rm /opt/etc/hosts
    cp /tmp/hosts /opt/etc/hosts
    cp /tmp/etc/group /opt/etc/group
    cp /tmp/etc/passwd /opt/etc/passwd
    cp /tmp/resolv.conf /opt/etc/resolv.conf
    ...
    Remove any other symplinks found in /opt/etc and /opt/var

After the ``/opt/etc`` and ``/opt/var`` folders are cleaned, we can put them
in use::

    mount -o bind /opt/etc /etc
    mount -o bind /opt/var /tmp/var

Get and install OpenWRT's package manager, ``opkg`` for you CPU. Most probably
opkg will be installed somewhere in ``/jffs`` but can me moved in your
prefered location::

    cd /jffs/tmp
    wget http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages/opkg_618-3_ar71xx.ipk
    ipkg install opkg*.ipk
    rm opkg*.ipk
    mv /jffs/bin/opkg /opt/bin/
    mv /jffs/etc/opkg.conf /opt/etc/

Now we can configure ``opkg`` to work with our writable folders, by editing
``/etc/opkg.conf`` to look like::

    src/gz snapshots http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/packages
    dest root /opt
    dest ram /opt/tmp
    lists_dir ext /opt/var/opkg-lists
    option overlay_root /overlay

Since not all libraries from DD-WRT are compatible with OpenWRT, you would
need to instruct the shell to use OpenWRT libraries first. Add the following
in your terminal and ~/.profile file::

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='/opt/lib:/opt/usr/lib'

Everything should be ok now, and ``opkg update``, ``opkg list`` and
``opkg install netstat`` should be functional.

The last step is to add a startup script that will mount the writable
partations at each boot. Create a file in
``/jffs/etc/config/open-wrt-init.startup`` with the follwing commands::

    mount -o bind /opt/etc /etc
    mount -o bind /opt/var /tmp/var

Enjoy the compiled tools provided by OpenWRT!

Play with the new /etc/passwd file and create a proper home for your root
account... /opt/root should fit.
