Somehow I got a 2U rack mountable server but I was missing a rack.
I was in the mood for making something, other than software, so I start
searching and planning to build a *rack*... actually a frame to mount the
rails.

With some spare wood around provided by my father and inspiration from
`Lack Rack <http://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/LackRack>`_, we made the plans for
building a wood based rack.

While mounting the rails is a bit more complicated than with one based on
angle bars, it has the advantage of being cheap and easy to work with.

You can make it as tall as you want... I ended up with a 18U since this was
the available space in the attic... so the height does not really mater.

I didn't have a *real rack* to measure so I just measured the server and
rails.

The most important measurement is the inside distance.
Based on experimental measurements I choose **450mm**. 

The depth is not so important, as most rails are adjustable in length. I
choose **900mm**.

The job is to cut the wood, buy a few metal plates, corner metal plates and
wood screws and they put all this parts into a single piece.

Start by making the front and back frames. They are very important as
the rails will be mounted inside this frames. Do frequent measurement as
you build them, both for distance and square angles. Don't forget to bring
a try square.

After you have the front and back frames, connect them with
the transversal beams. Use the try square as a guide.

Reinforce some corners using the corner metal plates. No need to do this
for all corners.

Some rails have a *smart* no-screws clipping system, but this does not goes
well with the wood. I had to make some cuts in the wood to attach the rails.

Here is the back top join. Use the same binding for bottom.

Here are some details for bottom back bindings:

Here are some details for top back bindings:

Here are some details for top front bindings.

The top frames extends the sides a bit higher to allow mounting a switch
or other light weight equipments... maybe a cable organized.
My extension are on the front, like a rugby goal, since I could not extend
them in the back.

Next I plan to mount a small LCD screen on the front extensions and put some
wheels.

That is all. Time to relax.
