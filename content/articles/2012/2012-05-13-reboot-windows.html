I spend almost all of my time in the Unix part of the world.
I enjoy the wide open landscapes from Linux land.

From time to time I have to take a trip into the Windows(TM) part of the
world, with more frequent visits to a highly acclaimed place called
Windows Server.

While visiting Windows, I always have the feeling of visiting a ghetto. There
is a constant thread of virus infections, everyone wants to pimp your Internet
Explorer with a fancy toolbar. You are offered free products with many
strings attached. You are tempted to start using a free product just to
discover later that you can not stop using it, even though you would like to.
I am not sure why so many people prefer living in these places. 

One thing that I constantly forget while I am on Windows territories is to
do a reboot after doing anything more complex than installing and configuring
Google Chrome... don't get me wrong, installing Google Chrome on Windows
Server, as Administrator, is not what I would call a trivial task.

When things lose their logic, don't ask why and just reboot and enjoy the
result.
