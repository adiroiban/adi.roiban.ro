I present you my weekend hack: a quick and dirty theme for `Trac`_ based on
`Twitter Boostrap`_.

Source `code is here`_ for your examination.

I am not a big fan of Trac's default look, and until now I was using Agilo
for Trac... just because it looks cool. To bad there is no separate theme, and
together with a nice Agilo's nice theme you also receive a lot of
indoctrination from the church of holy Enterprise Agile.

I am not using any of the extra features from Agilo and they were blocking
some other cool Trac extensions like `email2trac`_ or `batch modify`_.

So, here are the mandatory screenshots...
