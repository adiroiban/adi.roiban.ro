adi.roiban.ro website
=====================

This is a mixture or source code and publised HTML file for my personal blog.

It uses `Hyde <https://github.com/hyde/hyde>`_.

The website is still in development as I migrate the content and features
from WordPress.

For building this site I looked for documentation from
`Trae Blain's code <https://github.com/traeblain/traeblain.com>`_ for
`his website <http://traeblain.com>`_ and
`Merlin Rebrovic's Hyde Starte Kit
<https://github.com/merlinrebrovic/hyde-starter-kit>`_
